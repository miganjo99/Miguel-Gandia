# Miguel Gandia Jorda

Driven by a profound passion for IT, I made a bold decision to radically change my career path. After several years of experience as a teacher, I realized my true interest lay in the field of technology. In 2023, I took a decisive step by enrolling in an advanced program in Web Application Development. 

This comprehensive course has allowed me to deepen my understanding of web technologies and gain practical skills. My goal is to leverage this knowledge to become a skilled web programmer and contribute effectively to the tech industry.
